📊 Uber Cancellation Analysis — Power BI
🎯 Business Problem

Ride cancellations increased significantly, impacting revenue, user experience, and operational efficiency.
The objective of this analysis was to identify the main drivers behind cancellations and propose actionable business decisions to reduce them.

🧠 Analytical Approach

The analysis focused on identifying operational and behavioral patterns across:
Time (day & time window)
Geographic zones
Traffic level
Service type
Waiting time threshold
The project combines descriptive analytics + business interpretation to translate data into decisions.

>7 minutes waiting time = structural break
Cancellation jumps from 7.1% → 36.6%
This is the main operational driver.

Critical Threshold

![Momento critico](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc892f61-1872-49bc-97be-4c403a092b0f)

Key findings:

Friday = highest cancellation day
Night (18–23) = highest risk time window
High traffic strongly increases cancellations
Peripheral zones become critical under congestion


Business Insights

Cancellation is not just operational → it is strategic
Supply-demand imbalance drives user frustration
Perceived waiting time matters as much as real waiting time
Service reliability is key to retention
